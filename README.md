## Repo with some simple cpp revision
+ `containers/` dir with my simple implementations for basic data structures: currently there are:
    + Linked list
    + Stack
    + Queue
    + Vector (I tried to implement a kind of allocator but it turned out to be very messy due to my small xp points, but generally revised pointers once more)
+ Still planning to implement these data structures:
    + Ordinary binary tree
    + Red-black tree
    + Heap
    + Set (it should be a kind of tree too, i guess?)
    + Deque (why not?)
    + Map/Dictionary using hashmaps
    + Priority queue (seems to be the most complicated by now)
+ `gcc build.c++ -o build` to let git ignore executables
